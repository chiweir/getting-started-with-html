    World Wide Web
    <br>
    The world wide web is a collection of HTML documents that was invented in the 1990s and now emcompasses around 30 billion pages.<br>
    All sorts of files can be found on the web, such as HTML (hypertext markup language), images, videos, and music.<br>
    You to the server:<br>
    The user (you) accesses a browser which makes requests of a server via the internet. The requests use HTTP, the main protocol of the web. The browser then displays the files found on the web.<br>
    HTML is the heart of the web. It includes text content, mark-up, references to other documents and links to other pages.<br>
    HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. <br>
    All whitespace in HTML is converted to a single space. <br>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
